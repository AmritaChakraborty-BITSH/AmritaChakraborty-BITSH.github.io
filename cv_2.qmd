## RESEARCH INTERESTS

My primary research interest focuses on creating nanostructures with intriguing physicochemical properties through chemical interactions between nanoparticles of varying sizes, and examining their potential for diverse applications. This includes the synthesis of anisotropic noble metal nanoparticles and atomically precise nanoclusters, their systematic assembly, and the investigation of structural chirality for ultrasensitive biomarker detection. My current research investigates the molecular organization of interfaces and the mechanism of ion transport through lipid membranes using nonlinear optical spectroscopy.
